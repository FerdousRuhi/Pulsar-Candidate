Pulsar is a celestial object. It is a rapidly rotating neutron star.It emits regular pulses of radio waves.

In this project, I have worked on a dataset of pulsar candidates.

In the dataset, pulsar candidates collected during the HTRU survey. Candidates are classified as pulsar and non-pulsar classes.

HTRU2 is a dataset which describes a sample of pulsar candidates collected during the High Time Resolution Universe Survey (South)

The class labels used are 0 (negative) and 1 (positive).

In the dataset, each candidate is described by 8 continuous variables, and a single class variable.

The attributes are:
	1. Mean of the integrated profile.
	2. Standard deviation of the integrated profile.
	3. Excess kurtosis of the integrated profile.
	4. Skewness of the integrated profile.
	5. Mean of the DM-SNR curve.
	6. Standard deviation of the DM-SNR curve.
	7. Excess kurtosis of the DM-SNR curve.
	8. Skewness of the DM-SNR curve.
	9. Class

HTRU2 Summary:
	-> 17,898 total examples.
	-> 1,639 positive examples.
	-> 16,259 negative examples.
